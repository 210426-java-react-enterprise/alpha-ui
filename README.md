# AlphaCast Weather and Events Application (UI)

Alphacast is a service for anyone who's ever been stuck at a rained out ball game or turned up to a beach party and been told no one can get in the water due to thunder. It combines the utility of the OpenWeatherMap API and the Seatgeek API to keep you abreast of not only the hottest events in your area but also how hot your area is. Users have the ability to see the weather and events for any given city as well as set their hometown for a streamlined experience. Users can see both the hourly weather for the day or get a seven day forecast. With both email and text notifications knowing how to dress for your hotly anticipated outing has never been more convenient.

## Explanation of Technology

This application was built with the ReactJS Library.  It utilizes Axios to handle HTTP requests with our backend API.  Centralized state management is handled with Redux.  The application makes use of 3rd party API's including openweathermap.org to populate current and forecast weather data as well as seatgeek.com for current events.  Styling and grid layout for front end was aided by the use of the react-bootstrap, html, and css.  Testing was handled with Jest and Enzyme.
